DPI 912 Malware Project
USE CASE SCENARIO

- Users may wish to use their idle machines as bitcoin generating services. Similar applications include Razer Cortex and the
  Brave Browser. They will install and run our software thinking it will earn them passive crypto currency in a topic they
  will most likely be ignorant of, but still wish to engage with.

- Once installed, only requiring python and a few harmless enough libraries, the client will turn their machine into a reverse
  port-forwared daemon, responding to requests from the server. The initial request will simply be to start a key logging software.

- Every key pressed from launch to close is then recorded and sent to the server from the reverse client, and recorded into that
  date's corresponding txt file. Even if offline, the client will send once internet access is re-established.

- Should the program be found out, the data is already server-side with little reprecussion available to the attack vector.
